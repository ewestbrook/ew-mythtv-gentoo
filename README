--------------------------

This project is a set of Gentoo ebuilds for MythTV.  Why?  Cleaner,
better, easier!

* Easily stay up to date with CURRENT stable or unstable MythTV
  releases!

    You've probably observed that portage's MythTV ebuilds aren't even
    anywhere CLOSE to current.

* Consistent version numbers that make sense!

    * You can always rely on the order from old to new and stable to
      unstable.

    * You can always identify your version with the rest of the MythTV
      world.

    * The stable -fixes branches are arch-ready, and the unstable
      "bleeding-edge" versions are easily keywordable for ~arch.

    * For example:

        * 0.24.1289264034 for a specific version of the fixes/0.24
          branch;

        * 0.24.9999999999 for the latest bleeding-edge fixes/0.24
          branch;

        * 999.999.1291787075 for a specific version of trunk/master;

        * 999.999.9999999999 for latest bleeding-edge trunk/master.

* One ebuild for all plugins!

    Gentoo's "plugins" ebuilds for MythTV are simply out of control!
    We maintain one ebuild, and you select your plugins with USE
    flags.  Much cleaner!

* Easy to use and update!

    Just clone/fetch/pull and emerge.  No per-version /etc/make.conf
    hacks or other nonsense required.

--------------------------

One-time setup:

* Clone the mythtv-gentoo repo somewhere convenient, say
  /usr/local/mythtv-gentoo:

    $ git clone git://github.com/ewestbrook/mythtv-gentoo.git /usr/local/mythtv-gentoo

* Tell your /etc/make.conf about it, as an overlay directory:

    $ echo 'PORTDIR_OVERLAY="${PORTDIR_OVERLAY} /usr/local/mythtv-gentoo"' >> /etc/make.conf

* (Optional, recommended) Mask all of portage's ridiculous mythtv
  plugins ebuilds:

    $ for i in mytharchive mythbrowser mythflix mythgallery mythmovies mythmusic mythnews mythvideo mythweather mythzoneminder ; do echo "media-plugins/$i" >> /etc/portage/package.mask ; done

* (Optional, recommended) Unmask our own ebuilds, in case portage has
  masks that shouldn't apply to us:

    $ for i in media-tv/mythtv media-plugins/mythplugins www-apps/mythweb x11-themes/mythtv-themes ; do echo $i >> /etc/portage /package.unmask ; done

--------------------------

Emerge anytime!

* Update (if necessary):

    $ pushd /usr/local/mythtv-gentoo && git fetch && git pull && popd

* Emerge:

    $ emerge -av mythtv mythplugins mythweb mythtv-themes

* Enjoy!
